# Doer

This notepad application is so lightweight it saves and reads text to and from just one file.  
With almost no user interface, it works great as a place to keep your notes in.

It was built to replace a giant collection of small paper notes scattered all over my workspace and home.  
Comes in handy as a to-do list. Can also help you keep those pretty Japanese smileys at hand.
